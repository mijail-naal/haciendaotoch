Later it functioned as a military barracks, federal secondary school, public jail and headquarters of the Third District Court. It currently houses a theater and the Pedro Sainz de Baranda public library. The property was adapted and currently retains the style in which it was built. The former loom occupies a building made of masonry with vaulted ceilings supported by buttresses. Its dimensions are 45 by 75 feet, occupying a total extension of about 150 by 200 feet.

On the roof of the cenote you can see some bird nests that come and go, creating a noisy but at the same time spectacular atmosphere.</p>
