                    <p>Pedro Sainz de Baranda established in 1824 La Aurora de la Industria Yucateca, a spinning and weaving factory. The company was destroyed by fire during an attack by Mayan rebels in 1845 and remained abandoned for several years. Later it functioned as a military barracks, federal secondary school, public jail and headquarters of the Third District Court. It currently houses a theater and the Pedro Sainz de Baranda public library. The property was adapted and currently retains the style in which it was built. The former loom occupies a building made of masonry with vaulted ceilings supported by buttresses. Its dimensions are 45 by 75 feet, occupying a total extension of about 150 by 200 feet. The construction is surrounded by a fence of more than three meters high.</p>
